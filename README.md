# 👋 Hi, I'm Mateusz Lisiecki

I'm a data analyst with a solid foundation in life sciences and a growing passion for data-driven business decision-making. I recently completed the **Data Analytics Career Accelerator** at the **London School of Economics**, where I worked on real-world projects using **Python, SQL, R, Tableau, and Excel**.

With over a decade of experience in scientific research and field trial design, I bring a unique perspective to data analysis—combining analytical rigor with a strategic mindset. I'm passionate about transforming complex datasets into clear, actionable insights that empower smarter, evidence-based decisions.

### ❄️ **Gaea AI – Ice Sales Analysis with Market Segmentation & Predictive Modeling**

This project was completed as part of a collaborative effort with a 4-person team for Gaea AI, where we focused on analyzing ice sales at petrol stations within 65 km of Madrid. We leveraged **Python** and various data science libraries to clean, merge, and explore the data, uncovering insights into trends driven by external factors such as extreme heat, seasonality, and weekly patterns (e.g., weekends, festivals).

#### **Key Contributions:**
- Identified **seasonal** and **weekly trends** in ice sales using time series visualizations in **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**
- Investigated the impact of environmental factors (e.g., heatwaves) and social events (e.g., holidays) on demand
- Conducted **market segmentation** using **K-Means clustering**, optimizing strategies for each segment
- Built **Decision Trees** and **Random Forest** models using **Scikit-learn** to predict sales in each segment
- Delivered actionable recommendations for **restocking strategies** and **forecasting improvements**


### 🛠️ **Tech Stack:**
- **Python**, **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Seaborn**, **Matplotlib**, **Scikit-learn**, **Jupyter Notebook**, **SciPy**
