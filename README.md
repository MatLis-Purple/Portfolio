### ❄️ **Gaea AI – Ice Sales Analysis with Market Segmentation & Predictive Modeling**

📍 *Sales analysis for ice sold at petrol stations within 65 km of Madrid*

This project was completed as part of a collaborative effort with a 4-person team for Gaea AI, where we focused on analyzing ice sales at petrol stations. We leveraged **Python** and various data science libraries to clean, merge, and explore the data, uncovering insights into trends driven by external factors such as extreme heat, seasonality, and weekly patterns (e.g., weekends, festivals).

#### **Key Contributions:**
- Identified **seasonal** and **weekly trends** in ice sales using time series visualizations in **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**
- Investigated the impact of environmental factors (e.g., heatwaves) and social events (e.g., holidays) on demand
- Conducted **market segmentation** using **K-Means clustering**, optimizing strategies for each segment
- Built **Decision Trees** and **Random Forest** models using **Scikit-learn** to predict sales in each segment
- Delivered actionable recommendations for **restocking strategies** and **forecasting improvements**
